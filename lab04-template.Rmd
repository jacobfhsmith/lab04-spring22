```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
``` 

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
states <- st_read("cb_2020_us_state_20m.shp", quiet = TRUE)
census <- read_csv("census_2020_lower48.csv")
```

# Exercise 1

Contract.

# Exercise 2
```{r ex-2}
```

Use the proper join to create the `census_data` data set and please remember to name your chunk.

# Exercise 3

```{r us-plot-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(census_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ______)) + 
  # please remember to give your plot a title and to label the legend
  # you may also want to give your plot a theme here
```

# Exercise 4

```{r ex-4}
```

# Exercise 5

```{r us-plot-2, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(census_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ______)) + 
  # adjust the color here and remember to give your plot a midpoint
  # please remember to give your plot a title and to label the legend
  # you may also want to give your plot a theme here
```

# Exercise 6

```{r us-plot-3, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(census_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ______)) + 
  # adjust the color here and remember to give your plot a midpoint
  # please remember to give your plot a title and to label the legend
  # you may also want to give your plot a theme here
```

# Exercise 7

```{r us-plot-4, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(census_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = ______)) + 
  # adjust the color here
  # please remember to give your plot a title and to label the legend
  # you may also want to give your plot a theme here
